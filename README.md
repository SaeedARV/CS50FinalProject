# Matrix Calculator

This is the final project of [CS50’s Introduction to Computer Science](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x) course.  

### Overview:
My final project is a simple matrix calculator that allows the user to enter a matrix and see its determinant and inverse. The user can also enter a second matrix and see two matrices addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

### Description::
I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript to implement this project. In the index.html file, you can see the structure of my web page written in HTML. You can see that I Included Bootstrap’s CSS and JS as well. I used a few numbers of Bootstrap classes, but the styles.css file that I wrote in the CSS folder had a more important role in styling the web page. The script.js in the js folder is another important file that contains the most important part of this project, matrix operation algorithms. 
I used the analytic solution to calculate the inverse of matrices. There are some functions in my script.js file: cofactor, determinant, adjoint, and inverse. All these functions should be used to calculate the division of two matrices.
